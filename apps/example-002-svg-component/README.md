# SVG Component Example

```
ng generate component SVG --app example-002-svg-component
ng generate component SVG-element --app example-002-svg-component
```

TODO:

1. Figure out if svg can be loaded dynamically or if I should just copy the content to the HTML of the component?

2. If loaded dynamically, can it still detect subcomponents.

3. Can I create an event handler that traps clicks and hovers without mapping to ng component...Note subcomponents work well and it pretty powerful. So might want to continue to investigate
that.
