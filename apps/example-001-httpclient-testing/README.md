# GOAL

Goal: Initial goal is to just demo HttpClient testing. However as this is the first
      app it also lays some of the foundation off subsequent apps and the playground
      website in General. So some of the major themes that are touched
        * Nx for mono repo of multiple apps
        * Component sharing across these apps (Header for now)
        * CI/CD setup for the project.
        * Final output: 1. site, 2. test, 3. test coverage, 4. readme/blog 5. short video
